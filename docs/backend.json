The structure ensures that access control is straightforward and doesn't rely on complex hierarchical `get()` calls, which improves security and simplifies debugging. The segregation of user data into individual user documents provides a homogeneous security posture for each user's information. This design facilitates secure `list` operations, as access is determined by the path structure."
