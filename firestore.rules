/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for StreamCart User Data
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data stored under their specific user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` MUST match the Firebase Authentication UID of the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent unauthorized access to the user base.
 * - Write access is strictly limited to the owning user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * No denormalization is needed as the path itself (`/users/{userId}`) provides the necessary information for authorization. The `userId` path parameter is directly compared to `request.auth.uid`.
